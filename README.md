### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am skilled with PHP, Mysql, Laravel, Code-igniter, Vue JS, HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript and React. I have 9+ years of experience, and I am eager to learn even more technologies to sharpen my skillset. In addition to web technologies, I do have a passion for Rest Apis. I've worked on a few mobile side projects.
In addition to the skills I have acquired, and the extensive computer science education I have possess. I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements.
